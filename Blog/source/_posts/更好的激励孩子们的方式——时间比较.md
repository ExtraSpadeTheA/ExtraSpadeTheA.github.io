# 更好的激励孩子们的方式——时间比较

---

​	<font size=5>W</font>hen parents ask, "What grade did you get?" there is a common follow-up question: "So who got the highest grade?" The practice of making such social comparisons is popular in all corners of the world, research shows. Adults praise children for outperforming others. Sports tournaments award those who surpass others. Most social comparisons are so common in daily life that they are usually glossed over. Yet social comparisons can backfire. children can learn to always compare themselves with those around them and become trapped in a vicious cycle of competition.

> 经典的全球父母现状——"别人家的孩子", 社会性的比较已经司空见惯, 即使这会让孩子们陷入竞争的恶性循环, 也就是开卷.

​	How can we make children feel proud of themselves and motivate them with out the unwanted side effects? We believe a better approach is to use temporal comparisons——encouraging children to compare themselves with their past self rather than with others, such as by assessing how much they have learned or improved themselves. When children compare themselves with their past self, they don't compete with others. We investigated this approach in a recent study and found it effective. To set up the test, we had 583 children do a writing exercise designed to influence the kind of comparisons they would make: social comparisons, temporal comparisons or no comparison at all. For example, in the social-comparison condition, a nine-year-old girl wrote, "I was better than my peers at singing. I can sing and others can't. I find myself really important. I love singing, I keep doing it, and I'm simply the best." In the study, we found that children who compared themselves with others said they wanted to be superior to such people, while those who compared themselves with their past self said they wanted to improve rather than be superior. Temporal comparisons shifted children's goals away from a desire for superiority and toward self-improvement.

> 那么, 怎么做才能让孩子感到激励呢? 很简单, 用时间性比较代替社会性比较, 也就是自我对比, 从上述研究来看, 社会性比较的孩子总想比别人更强, 而时间性比较的孩子则更在意自我提升, 不过我认为两者可折中而行, 毕竟只关注自我而不放眼周身世界是不明智的, 但确实不需要过度与他人对比, 以寻求自我提升为主要目标即可.~~说起来容易, 做起来哪有那么简单~~

​	What, then, can parents and teachers do with this knowledge? For one. parents and teachers can praise children's improvement over time to let them know they are making progress and heading in the right direction. Also, teachers can create leaning contexts that track children's own progress over time, such as report cards that display their changes in learning and performance. By doing so, adults teach children tat outperforming oneself is more important than outperforming others and that even small victories may be celebrated.

> 老师和家长都可以用这样的方式鼓励并引导孩子们, 教导孩子们更加注重自我提升.

​	Of course, temporal comparisons are not a panacea. The road toward self-improvement is paved with struggles and setbacks, Rather than making children feel bad for those failures, we should encourage them to embrace and learn from them——and thus help youngsters become better than they were before.

> 时间比较不是万能药, 自我提升的道路终究是充满挣扎与挫折的, 只不过比起在意失败, 不如从中汲取教训更能让人上一层楼.
